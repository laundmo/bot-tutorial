## A tutorial that aims to provide a detailed explanation of how to create your very own cutom discord bot in Python, using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io) client library.

This tutorial will walk you through all the aspects of creating your own bot, from creating the bot user itself on the developer portal, to a brief overview of the Discord gateway and API, to coding the bot itself. All will be covered in depth in this tutorial.

Preamble over, you can start learning now in [Part 1 - Creating a Bot User,](docs/part1.md) do please note however that this is not a beginner Python tutorial. As such, a fair understanding of the Python language and its features is assumed in this tutorial, along with a base knowledge of Discord, such as what servers and channels are, how to join them, the basics really. Also, you'll likely find during development of bots that the [discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io) is of great assistance to you when you want to understand how to do something.
